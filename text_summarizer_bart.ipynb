It aims to capture the essence of the original text and present it in a concise and coherent manner. The goal of text summarization is to save time and effort for readers by providing a summary that captures the most important points of the document."

Extractive summarization methods typically rank sentences based on their importance, using techniques such as frequency analysis, statistical methods, or machine learning algorithms. The selected sentences are then arranged to create a coherent summary.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Abstractive Summarization**: In contrast to extractive summarization, abstractive summarization aims to generate a summary that may contain words, phrases, or even sentences that were not present in the original text. It involves understanding the meaning of the text and generating a summary in a more human-like manner. Abstractive methods often employ natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as language generation models, to paraphrase and generate new sentences that capture the essential information."

But Sturrock has distanced himself from the position. \\\"We're in a difficult situation. We must get out of it through the efforts of current personnel,\\\" said Thompson. \\\"Ian McCall and I have had a long and detailed talk about a number of areas including the current league position and the manner of the exit from the League Cup,\\\" he added. \\\"However, the continuing speculation is doing no one any good, especially as we have several crucial games coming up. \\\"The minds of the coaching staff and the players have to be on those games and those games only. \\\"Our season would of course improve considerably if in the next few weeks we achieved some improved league results and there is also the potential of another cup semi-final, subject to the draw...\\\"All that matters at the present time - is us all having a total focus on the games ahead and a positive series of results being achieved.\\\" Dundee United players had expressed their solidarity with McCall after their side's 3-0 Scottish Cup win over Queen of the South. \\\"We want the boss to stay, we don't want someone else coming in,\\\" said Jim McIntyre. \\\"Hopefully now he gets the chance to stay.\\\" Keeper Tony Bullock echoed McIntyre's sentiments. \\\"I think all the boys are behind Ian McCall,\\\" he added. \\\"At the moment it is all speculation and we have got to rise above all that and do a job on the pitch.\\\"..On Saturday, Sturrock insisted that he had unfinished business with Wednesday, who are fourth in League One. \\\"I've only been here five months and I don't expect to be leaving very, very soon,\\\" he said. \\\"I can appreciate the rumours because I've emphasised my thoughts and ambitions to go back to Dundee United. \\\"I can assure you the timescale is not the right one. \\\"It (Dundee United) is my team. I had five years there as a coach, six as a player, two years as a manager - once you've done that kind of thing, it's the result you look for. \\\"The important thing now is I've come here to do a job and I'm going to try to finish it.\\\"\",\n          \"Brown calls for \\u00a35.5bn Aids fund..Gordon Brown has called on rich nations to fund a \\u00a35.5bn ($10bn) plan to fight the Aids epidemic and find a vaccine...On the fourth day of his six-day tour of Africa, the UK chancellor predicted a vaccine could be found by 2012 if the world stepped up its funding pledges. Doubling the \\u00a3400m being spent yearly on finding such a vaccine could advance it by three years and save six million lives, Mr Brown said on Thursday. He hopes to use the UK's G8 presidency to push the issue forward...\\\"I believe that the generation that provided the finance to combat, cure and eradicate the world's deadliest disease of today - and today the world's least curable disease - HIV/Aids - will rightly earn the title 'the great generation',\\\" Mr Brown said in a speech during his African tour. The problems of HIV/Aids were inseparable from poverty, he added. \\\"At least $10 billion per annum (\\u00a35.5bn) is needed to address the HIV/Aids crisis in low and middle income countries. \\\"Existing financial commitments on their own will not stop the pandemic. \\\"The UK's proposal for an International Finance Facility is so important - increasing world aid flows by over $50 billion (\\u00a327bn). A doubling of world aid to halve world poverty.\\\" Mr Brown also said he had agreed with the Italian finance minister Domenico Siniscalco to push forward with plans for the world-wide sharing and co-ordination of research into the disease...Currently the private sector was only spending \\u00a360m a year on seeking an inoculation and the market needed boosting, Mr Brown said. He called on industrialised nations to commit themselves to buying the first 300m vaccines at a cost of $20 each, thereby boosting the market for inoculations. This would be a \\\"large enough inducement to create much stronger interest from both large and small pharmaceutical firms\\\", Mr Brown added...More must also be done to finance the treatment and care of those living with HIV/Aids and their families, he said. But Aid charity Actionaid criticised Mr Brown's preoccupation with finding a vaccine and called on G8 nations to fund HIV/Aids treatments. The charity's head of HIV/Aids in Britain, Simon Wright said: \\\"While encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to discover an HIV vaccine is important, a failure to provide any funding for HIV treatments condemns a generation of people to death. \\\"HIV is decimating African countries, killing the most productive adults who should be working, caring for children and building the economy. An HIV vaccine is probably at least 10 years away. Treatments are needed now.\\\" On Wednesday, Mr Brown visited slums in the Kenyan capital Nairobi . He will visit an HIV/Aids orphanage in Tanzania and a women's credit union in Mozambique before chairing a meeting of the Commission for Africa in Cape Town. The chancellor has already unveiled proposals for a G8 aid package which he has likened to the Marshall Plan used by the United States to rebuild Europe after World War Two.\",\n          \"Asia shares defy post-quake gloom..Thailand has become the first of the 10 southern Asian nations battered by giant waves at the weekend to cut its economic forecast...Thailand's economy is now expected to grow by 5.7% in 2005, rather than 6% as forecast before tsunamis hit six tourist provinces. The full economic costs of the disaster remain unclear. In part, this is because of its scale, and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. But Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs on Wednesday, suggesting that investors do not fear a major economic impact...The highs showed the gap in outlook between investors in large firms and individuals who have lost their livelihoods...Investors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas - such as Aceh in Indonesia - were so under-developed that the tragedy would little impact on Asia's listed companies, according to analysts. \\\"Obviously with a lot of loss of life, a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess, bury the people and find the missing. But it's not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense,\\\" said ABN Amro chief Asian strategist Eddie Wong. India's Bombay Stock Exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on Wednesday. Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of South East Asia. In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. Sri Lanka's stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend, but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004...Thailand may lose 30bn baht (\\u00a3398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome...In the affected provinces, he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. Thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work. \\\"It will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in Phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level,\\\" said Naris Chaiyasoot, director general at the ministry's fiscal policy office. In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. \\\"Our nation is in peril here,\\\" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. The Maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. \\\"It won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,\\\" he said. \\\"In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this.

Three further O'Gara penalties extended Ireland's lead to 17-6 as the game entered the final quarter. Two Percy Montgomery penalties set up a frantic finish but Ireland held out to claim a famous victory. Ireland began strongly and were never led, but the match was tense and closely fought throughout. Aware of the threat posed by the South Africans, Ireland pressed hard from the outset, and played some impressive rugby while searching for a breakthrough. Early on, Denis Hickie thought he was in for a try after a delightful backline move but Shane Horgan's pass was adjudged to have gone forward by referee Paul Honiss...Ireland continued to press and they showed their intent by opting for a line-out in the 19th minute when three straight-forward points were on offer. Another South African infringement a minute later led to Ireland's first points - O'Gara took a quick tap-penalty and charged over the opposition line for an Irish try. The Springboks could feel hard done by as captain John Smit had his back to the play when O'Gara pounced after referee Honiss had told the skipper to warn his own players after consistent infringements. Stung by the score, the South Africans almost replied with a try of their own within 60 seconds with Geordan Murphy's ankle-tap tackle denying a certain try for Percy Montgomery. However, the Springboks did win a penalty a minute later which Montgomery easily slotted to cut Ireland's lead to 5-3...Ireland got out of jail when the South Africans had a three-to-one overlap near the Irish line only to waste the chance. After the sustained Springboks pressure, the Irish produced an attack of their own in the 34th minute which culminated with O'Gara's clever drop-goal to restore his side's lead to five points which remained the margin at half-time. Sustained Irish pressure immediately after half-time was rewarded by another O'Gara penalty. However, Montgomery responded quickly by slotting over a superb penalty from near the right touchline to cut Ireland's lead to five points again. Montgomery then burst through the Irish defence in the 48th minute and it took a superb Girvan Dempsey tackle to prevent a try. The South Africans suffered a double-blow in the 52nd minute when Schalk Burger was sin-binned for the second week in a row after killing the ball and O'Gara punished the transgression by notching another penalty...In the 61st minute, Hickie was left frustrated by a poor pass from Girvan Dempsey as a chance to seal the match was wasted. However, a late tackle on Brian O'Driscoll enabled O'Gara to notch another penalty in the 63rd minute which extended Ireland's lead to 17-6. However, two Montgomery penalties had Ireland's lead in peril again as the Springboks closed to within five points with seven minutes remaining. South Africa produced a huge effort in the closing minutes but Ireland held on to claim a deserved victory...G Dempsey; G Murphy, B O'Driscoll (capt), S Horgan, D Hickie; R O'Gara, P Stringer; R Corrigan, S Byrne, J Hayes, M O'Kelly, P O'Connell, S Easterby, J O'Connor, A Foley...F Sheahan, M Horan, D O'Callaghan, E Miller, G Easterby, D Humphreys, K Maggs...: P Montgomery; B Paulse, M Joubert, De Wet Barry, A Willemse, J van der Westhuyzen; F Du Preez; O Du Randt, J Smit (captain), E Andrews, B Botha, V Matfield, S Burger, AJ Venter, J van Niekerk...: H Shimange, CJ van der Linde, G Britz, D Rossouw, M Claassens, J de Villiers, G du Toit/J Fourie...Paul Honiss (New Zealand)\",\n          \"Zambia confident and cautious..Zambia's technical director, Kalusha Bwalya is confident and cautious ahead of the Cosafa Cup final against Angola on Saturday in Lusaka...Bwalya said: \\\"Nothing short of victory will do.\\\" However Bwalya warned his side not to be too complacent. \\\"I don't want my team to be too comfortable or too sure of victory as it is going to be a difficult game. \\\"For me the main aim of the game is to enjoy and to win.\\\" Zambia have shown their determination to win this final by recalling nine of their foreign-based players. However the 41 year-old Bwalya, who became the oldest player to appear in the competition when he played and scored against Mauritius, is uncertain whether he will take to the field or not. The Chipolopolo fans however are not being so cautious with a 'victory' concert already scheduled for after the match featuring some of the country's top musicians. Both sides are hoping to win the competition for a record third time, and so keep the trophy for good. The Chipolopolo won the first two editions of the regional tournament for Southern African nations in 1997 and 1998. They were prevented from a third straight win by Angola who knocked out the Zambians at the semi-final stage in 1999. That victory for Angola also marked a first defeat in 14 years for Zambia at Lusaka's Independence stadium, where Saturday's game is being played. Angola named just four overseas-based players in their preliminary squad. The Palancas Negras have been unable to secure the release of many of their Portugal-based players.\",\n          \"EU software patent law delayed..Controversial new EU rules for the patenting of computer-based inventions have been put on hold due to a last minute intervention from Poland...Poland - a large and therefore crucial EU member - has requested more time to consider the issue, especially as it relates to the patenting of software. Critics say the law would favour large companies over small, innovative ones. They say it could have massive ramifications for developments such as open source software...Polish ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes the patenting of software. The planned law has ignited angry debate about whether the EU should allow the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods as currently happens in the US. So, for instance, US-based Amazon.com holds a patent on 'one-click shopping'. Critics claim the law, which the EU says is needed to harmonise with the US, is little more than a law on ideas. \\\"Patent rights, it is claimed, protect inventors but in this case it is exclusively the interests of the big companies that are protected,\\\" Eva Lichtenberg, a Austrian Green member of the European Parliament said in a statement. \\\"Smaller, innovative firms cannot afford the patenting and legal costs that the directive would inflict on them,\\\" she added. The European Parliament has already clashed with the European Union on the issue and there have been accusations that the process to decide the issue has been undemocratic.
